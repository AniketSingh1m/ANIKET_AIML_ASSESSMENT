    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>This project focuses on forecasting sourcing costs using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately predict sourcing costs based on historical data and relevant features.</p>

    <h2>XGBoost Performance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Test R2 Score: XGBoost has the highest test R2 score of 0.4039 among all the models.</li>
        <li>Test RMSE and MAE: XGBoost also performs well in terms of test RMSE (40.2144) and test MAE (29.2672).</li>
        <li>Advantages of XGBoost:
            <ul>
                <li>Complexity Handling</li>
                <li>Regularization</li>
                <li>Feature Importance</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
